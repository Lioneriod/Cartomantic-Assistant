This is a personal project of mine to help when reading cards.

Supports only major arcana for now!

### Why 🤷‍♂️
While I don't actually believe in the power of the cards and it's uses in divination, I gotta admit they are a bomb for those moments when we are uncertain. 

The truth is, most of the times we do know the answer already, but we are exhausted by just thinking about what will happen if that decision messes things up.

So yeah, I think tarot cards are a pretty useful as psychological tool, and I wanted a place to organize and improve all my card-interpretation-skills, and my teacher asked from a project with at least 2 services, so here we are. I hope you enjoy it!


### Architecture and technical thingys 🤓
- Monolithic architecture;
- One API that holds all the info on each card and their direction/order;
- Events **based** integration

### Tools used in this project 🔧
- Node.js
- Render (to keep that API running)
- HTML and CSS (flexbox and grid)
- n8n (yep, feast your eyes on this project super duper small project, you AI afficionados!)

### How to use it 🪄
You can acess the website here in github or just by loading the html + css + js on the same folder on your pc

Still, you're going to need to make it talk with your own n8n workflow, so I left an extra readme to guide you on it

### Endpoints and integration flows 😎
The API can be found here: https://cartomantic-assistant.onrender.com/api/cards
(yeah that's it)



### Extras🐈
I had fun doing this
